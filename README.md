# Event Center Website

This is a website for a hypothetical event center. A display of what I have learned using HTML and CSS so far.

## Description

I used classes to all for reuse of different bits of CSS to make the website as modular as possible, so that in the event the website were to expand or change in any way there is a solid base to do so.

Used a meta query to allow for the website layout to change dynamically based on the size of the users display (measured by pixels).
